Current Amherst college student of Computer Science and Political Science, my passion inside the classroom has been to understand the intersections of technology and politics.

At my core, I am a natural problem solver and enjoying help creatively set problems. This passion for solving problems has to lead to experience within Harvard Business School, a Silicon Valley VC, and a Wealth Management Firm.  

As of 2021, I will be joining Apple's Technology Investigation Team as an Engineering Undergraduate Intern.
