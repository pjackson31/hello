## Nice to meet you!

Current Amherst college student of Computer Science and Political Science, my studies have revolved around implications of hardwear and software within world politics and the 4th Industrial Revolution as a whole.

At my core, I am a natural problem solver, curious learner, and enjoying help creatively set problems. This passion for solving problems has to lead to experience within Harvard Business School, a Silicon Valley VC, and a Wealth Management Firm.  

As of 2021, I will be joining Apple's Technology Investigation Team as an Engineering Undergraduate Intern.
