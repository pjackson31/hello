We are in a new era in the 21st Century. This era has gone digital, and as a result, the way we work and the way we live will never be the same. Similar to many times of transition, there will be both positive and negative effects. 

Current Amherst college student of Computer Science and Political Science, my passion inside the classroom has been to understand the intersections of technology, politics, and finance. Recent project: "Alpha Green: Financial Singularity"

At my core, I am a natural problem solver. This passion for solving problems has to lead to experience within Harvard Business School, a Silicon Valley VC, and a Wealth Management Firm. At the VC, I was able to understand how software helps businesses build and develop strategies.
