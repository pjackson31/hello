We are in a new era in the 21st Century; a digital era that is going to change the way we work and the way we live. Similar to many times of transition, there will be both positive and negative effects. The world we live in is immensely interconnected and approaching a point of peak globalization, the coming effects of technology will be felt globally.

Current Amherst college student of Computer Science and Political Science, my passion is to understand the intersections of technology, politics, and finance in a world that is becoming increasingly globalized. 

At my core, I am a natural problem solver. This has led to my deep interest in business problems through my experience with Harvard Business School as well as within the Venture Capital space. At the VC, I was able to understand the way software helps businesses operate and help entrepreneurs find a competitive edge to disrupt segments of the B2B software market.
