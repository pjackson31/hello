## Nice to meet you!

Current Amherst college student of Computer Science and Political Science, my studies have revolved around the of hardwear and software of the 4th Industrial Revolution and how they intersect within world politics.

At my core, I am a natural problem solver, curious learner, and enjoying help creatively set problems. This passion for solving problems has to lead to experience within Harvard Business School, a Silicon Valley VC, and a Wealth Management Firm.  

As of 2021, I will be joining Apple.
