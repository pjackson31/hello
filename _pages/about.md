I am a current Amherst College student studying Computer Science and Political Science. At Amherst, my studies have revolved around machine learning and the role of technology in international relations. 

At my core, I am a natural problem solver, curious learner, and enjoying help creatively set problems. This passion for solving problems has led to experience within Harvard Business School, a Silicon Valley VC, and a Wealth Management Firm.  

As of 2021, I'm working @Apple as a Engineering Project Manager.
