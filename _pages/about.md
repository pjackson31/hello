We are in a new era in the 21st Century. This era has gone digital, and as a result, the way we work and the way we live will never be the same. Similar to many times of transition, there will be both positive and negative effects. 

Current Amherst college student of Computer Science and Political Science, my passion inside the classroom has been to understand the intersections of technology, politics, and finance. Explored in recent machine learning project: "Alpha Green" exploring possibilities of the "Financial Singularity".

At my core, I am a natural problem solver and enjoying help creatively set problems. This passion for solving problems has to lead to experience within Harvard Business School, a Silicon Valley VC, and a Wealth Management Firm.  

As of 2021, I am looking to master my craft and help build innovative software products for a summer internship.
