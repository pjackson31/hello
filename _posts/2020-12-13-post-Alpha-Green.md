### Question 
Will there be a Financial Singularity in the near future? This project juggles the possibility of creating an artificial intelligent agent that can perform trades within the NYSE stock market at a level consistantly above the average trader. 

### Project
Agent relies on on Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow and Keras for Deep Neural Networks and algorithms. 71 episodes of learning will be performed on an instance of each agent. Agent runs through 10+ strategies to explore all positions and maximize returns.

### Result
Overall, the agent performed well on both seen and unseen stock data
