POSC:145 Work 
_Amherst College Political Science Department_

Within the Amherst College Political Science Department I took a class centered around Work. I researched the changing landscape of work and the current Industrial Revolution is unlike any of the former. I concluded that nearly every industry will be revolutionized in some way from technologies such as cloud computing, machine learning, intelligent manufacturing, advanced robotics. 
As a result of this coursework, I looked to PeakSpan Capital, where I could be on the ground sourcing cutting edge business technologies and learn how idea transforms into execution.

“Data, hardwear and process automation can transfrom businesses and help them run more efficiently no matter the size.”  

At Peakspan, a Silicon Valley based Venture Capital Firm, I was able to map out and analyze numerous segments of the business to business software ecosystem. Over the course of internship, I led a variety of projects from daily updates to PeakSpan's algorithmic search engine to portfolio operation projects. 
After completing the internship I provided 200 investment prospects, HCM market map, and theme research analysis around Covid-19.
