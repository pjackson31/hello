### POSC:145 Work 
_Amherst College Political Science Department_

Within the Amherst College Political Science Department I took a class centered around Work. I researched the changing landscape of work and the current Industrial Revolution is unlike any of the former. I concluded that nearly every industry will be revolutionized in some way from technologies such as cloud computing, machine learning, intelligent manufacturing, advanced robotics. 
As a result of this coursework, I looked to PeakSpan Capital, where I could be on the ground sourcing cutting edge business technologies and learn how idea transforms into execution.

### PeakSpan Capital
 

At Peakspan, a Silicon Valley based Venture Capital Firm, I was able to map out and analyze numerous segments of the business to business software ecosystem. Over the course of internship, I led a variety of projects from daily updates to PeakSpan's algorithmic search engine to portfolio operation projects. 
After completing the internship I provided 200 investment prospects, HCM market map, and theme research analysis around Covid-19.
